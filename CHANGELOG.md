### Fixed

- Fixes issue with column name quotinc in many-to-many eager load
- Properly honor `--no-back-referencing` in relationship setops
- Retract `v4.9.0` due to issues with the commit tagging and the generated code showing `v4.8.6`

## [v4.9.0] - 2022-04-04

### Added

- Add `AllEnum()` function to retrieve a slice of all valid values of an enum type
- Add `DefaultTemplates` to `boilingcore.Config` to change the base template files to use for generation
- Add `CustomTemplateFuncs` to `boilingcore.Config` to supply additional functions that can be used in templates (thanks @ccakes)

- Removes duplicated `deleted_at IS NULL` clause in relationship queries (thanks @ktakenaka)

## [v4.8.6] - 2022-01-29

### Added

- Add missing function `func (modelQuery) DeleteAllGP(...)` (thanks @parnic)

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with generation of both nullable and non-nullable enum types (thanks @optiman)

## [v4.8.5] - 2022-01-28

### Added

- Add function `drivers.RegisterBinaryFromCmdArg()` to extract binary registration

## [v4.8.4] - 2022-01-27

### Added

- Add new --always-wrap-errors flag that does not unwrap sql.ErrNoRows
  so it can retain the stack trace. This supports the best practice of using
  errors.Is() anyway and will eventually become the default behavior in
  a breaking v5 (thanks @jhnj)
- Add support for \* as a wildcard for white/blacklisting columns. See readme
  for details (thanks @Yoshiji)
- Add missing function `func (modelQuery) UpdateAllGP(...)` (thanks @MeanSquaredError)
- Add support for generated columns
- Add support for database views
- Add a `_model` suffix to the generated file for tables names that end with
  `_test` or `_goos` or `_goarch` since Go treats such files specially.
- Add `C` in front of model column attributes that begin with a number since a struct
  field cannot begin with a number in Go
- Add **sqlite3** driver to the main repo using the CGo-free port

### Changes

- Modify the `--add-enum-types` flag to also use the generated types in the model
  fields (thanks @optiman)
- Mark nullable columns as having a default in Postgres driver
- Bump MySQL version used for testing to 8.0

### Fixed

- Fix panic when a column referrring a foreign key is ignored
  (thanks @zapo)
- Fix bug with using the zero value of the decimal type for a nullable column
  (thanks @hongshaoyang)

## [v4.8.3] - 2021-11-16

### Fixed

- Fix bad use of titlecase in mysql enum name generation

## [v4.8.2] - 2021-11-16

### Fixed

- Fix regression in enum name generation

## [v4.8.1] - 2021-11-14

### Fixed

- Fix a regression in the soft delete test template generation introduced in
  4.8.1

## [v4.8.0] - 2021-11-14

### Added

- Add `--add-enum-types` to create distinct enum types instead of strings
  (thanks @stephenamo)

### Fixed

- Fix a regression in soft delete generation introduced in 4.7.1
  (thanks @stephenamo)

## [v4.7.1] - 2021-09-30

### Changed

- Change template locations to templates/{main,test}. This unfortunate move
  is necessary to preserve old behavior.

### Fixed

- Revert change to boilingcore.New() both in behavior and function signature

## [v4.7.0] - 2021-09-26

### Added

- Add configuration for overriding custom timestamp column names
  (thanks @stephanafamo)

### Fixed

- Fix CVEs in transitive dependencies by bumping cobra & viper
- Fix inconsistent generation of IsNull/IsNotNull where helpers for types that
  appear both as null and not null in the database.
- JSON unmarshalling null into types.NullDecimal will no longer panic. String
  and format have been overridden to return "nil" when the underlying decimal
  is nil instead of crashing.

### Removed

- Removed bindata in favor of go:embed. This is not a breaking change as there
